# The Boogeyman

## Overview

The Boogeyman is a randomly selected player, that must kill another player during the session to cure themselves, otherwise they will be punished.

When the session starts, multiple players are randomly selected to become Boogeymen.

Only non-red players can become the Boogeyman, and they have to kill other non-red players to be cured.

Boogeyman rolling is completely secret, so no one else knows who the Boogeyman is!

If the boogeyman fails to kill another player before the end of the session, they will be dropped to their last life.

:::tip
Use the [`/boogeyman`](/commands/detailed/boogeyman) command to manage the Boogeymen.
