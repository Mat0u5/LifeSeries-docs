# Watchers

## Overview

Watchers are players who spectate the series without participating in it.

They are unaffected by most season mechanics, for example: They don't have lives, cannot become soulmates, ...

This is very useful for admins or players that want to observe the session without interfering with it.

:::tip
Use the [`/watcher`](/commands/detailed/watcher) command to manage the Watchers.
