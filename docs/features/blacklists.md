# Blacklists

## Overview

There are four types of blacklists:
- Item Blacklist: Prevents players from obtaining certain items (via crafting, picking up, etc.), and removes existing items.
- Block Blacklist: Prevents players from placing or right-clicking on certain blocks.
- Enchantment Blacklist: Prevents players from applying certain enchantments to items, and removes existing enchantments.
- Potion Effect Blacklist: Prevents players from obtaining certain potion effects, and removes existing effects.

Blacklists are useful to restrict overpowered items or items that don't fit the theme of your season.

By default, all helmets are blacklisted, along with some overpowered items, like the mace and end crystals.

## Customizability

Blacklists can be customized in the [Config](/config/overview).
