# Starting a Session

## Why even start a Session?

Sessions automatically track time for you, so for example, if your group has 3 hours of time to play, you just set the session timer to 3 hours, and the mod will automatically track it for you.

In most seasons, there are also automatic session actions, such as assigning who the Boogeyman is, turning on wildcards, assigning soulmates, etc.

## Starting a Session

To start a session, you must first set how long it will last. You can do that by using the `/session timer set <time>`.

Some examples of the `<time>` parameter format are:
- `3h` - 3 hours
- `1h45m` - 1 hour and 45 minutes
- `2h35m20s` - 2 hours, 35 minutes, and 20 seconds

Then you just run `/session start` to start the session!

## Pausing a Session / Ending prematurely

If you need to pause the session for any reason, you can use `/session pause`. This will pause the timer until you resume it with the same command.

If you need to end the session prematurely, you can use `/session stop`. This will immediately end the session, regardless of how much time is left.
