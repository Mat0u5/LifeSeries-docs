# Selecting a Season

## Client-side mod

If you have the mod client-side, selecting a season is very easy.<br>
When you first load in the world, you will be shown a season selection screen, where you can just click on the season you want to play.

If you want to change the season later on, you can use the `/lifeseries chooseSeries` command to open the same selection GUI again.

## Only server-side

If you do not have the mod client-side, you have to use the `/lifeseries setSeries <series>` command.

**Available values for `<series>`:**

| Season                    | `<series>`    |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Third Life                | `thirdlife`   |
| Last Life                 | `lastlife`    |
| Double Life               | `doublelife`  |
| Limited Life              | `limitedlife` |
| Secret Life               | `secretlife`  |
| Wild Life                 | `wildlife`    |
| Past Life                 | `pastlife`    |
| Real Life  (April Fools)  | `reallife`    |
| Simple Life (April Fools) | `simplelife`  |
