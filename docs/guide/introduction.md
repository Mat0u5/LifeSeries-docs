# Life Series Mod

## Introduction
This mod is a one-to-one recreation of [Grian](https://www.youtube.com/c/Grian)'s Life Series in Minecraft Fabric.

It adds everything from the original series, along with an incredible amount of quality of life features, and endless customizability.

## Feature Complete
This mod faithfully recreates all the seasons of the Life Series - everything works exactly as in the originals.

That is: `Third Life`, `Last Life`, `Double Life`, `Limited Life`, `Secret Life`, `Wild Life`, `Past Life`, and the April Fools seasons: `Real Life` and `Simple Life`.

All in a single mod. No more shady, unmaintained, buggy datapacks.

## Customizable
A big part of this mod that it is very customizable. 

There are over 100 customizable features, including default lives, boogeyman in any season, custom item blacklists, players subbing in, and much more.

## Requirements
[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required to run this mod, there are no other mod dependencies - although [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) is recommended.

The mod is server-side required and optional client-side.

::: tip Client-side features
While having the mod client-side is not required, having it adds a lot of cool features, such as:
- Colored hearts based on lives.
- Integrated session timer.
- Custom GUIs for managing the config.

::: warning Wild Life
Wild Life **requires** the mod to be installed client-side.

## Actively Maintained

I update this mod regularly when new minecraft versions come out, when new seasons of the Life Series are released, or when enough new content is added to the mod.

All versions from 1.21.0 to the latest version are maintained - meaning that new features will be available in **all the versions the mod supports**.

If you want to play developer versions of the mod, they are available on a separate Modrinth page: [Life Series Dev](https://modrinth.com/mod/life-series-dev).
