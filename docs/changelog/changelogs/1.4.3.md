You can no longer get new tasks when the session is finished when having red tasks or when the constant tasks config is turned on.
You can no longer self fail as the boogeyman if you've already failed or been cured.
Other bug fixes.

----------

Added the 'boogeyman_team_notice' global config, which shares who the other boogeymen are if you're a boogeyman.
Added the 'boogeyman_kills_needed' global config, which controls how many kills you need to cure yourself as the boogeyman.
Added the 'lives_system_disabled' global config, which fully disables the lives system, allowing for a custom implementation. Note that this disables literally everything. The lives command, default lives, dying removing a life all do not work for example.

----------

Snails now have the trivia layer always displayed.
Animal disguise now spawns two of the random animals in the finale when activating it.
Added the '/wildcard finale' command, which makes the wildcards act like they do in the finale (or during Callback). This resets once the session ends.

----------

The end of the transcript now contains a summary of how many kills and deaths each player had.
Added the 'wildcard_callback_nerfed_wildcards' Wild Life config. Default value is true.
Added the ${red} identifier to Secret Life tasks. Works similarly to ${green} and ${yellow}

----------

Moved '/secretlife changeLocations' to '/task changeLocations'
Right-clicking on Trivia Bots now properly consumes right clicks.

----------

Editing config values that require a server reload now automatically reloads instead of just telling you to do so.
Removed the snail texture info screen, replaced with a wiki link.

----------

Added the '/lifeseries wiki' and '/lifeseries help' commands, which both link you to the Life Series mod wiki.

----------

Fixed some death titles in Limited Life not showing correctly.
The Hunger wildcard now has a chance to play a sound effect when food is eaten.
Added the 'wildcard_hunger_sound_chance' Wild Life config, default value is 0.01 (1%).
Added the 'wildcard_snails_effects' Wild Life config, which controls whether snails can have potion effects. Default value is false.

Claimkills now count towards player kill scoreboards.
Added the 'boogeyman_steal_life' global config, which makes boogeymen gain a life when they are cured. Default value is false.
