Bug Fixes

- Minimal armor pack changes:

  - Added the two missing armor trims (flow and bolt) for minimal armor.

Removed all dependencies from the mod (Polymer and BIL, which were used for rendering custom entities - snail and trivia bot), which will allow me to control their rendering more, and it will speed up development time, allow me to update to newer versions (and snapshots!) faster.
Custom rendering for the snail and trivia bot - this should fix ALL bugs with snails / bots being invisible sometimes.
The trivia bot quiz screen now shows the trivia entity in 1.21.6+.
Adding snail skins no longer requires a full reload (no more reloading screen on the client yipiiee).

When a player stops subbing in for another player, their lives now return to what they were before.
You can no longer sit on snails and trivia bots with the superpunch power.
