Completely reworked the command feedback system.
The following commands now accept multiple targets instead of just one: '/lives add/remove/set/reset' '/soulmate reset', '/health add/remove/set/reset', '/superpower set/assignForRandomization', '/snail names reset'

----------

Team colors now work properly in Limited Life again.

----------

Added the '/superpower reset ⟨player⟩' command, which resets the superpower of specific players.
Removed the '/supeprower resetAll' command, same can be achieved with '/superpower reset @a'

The config GUI no longer gives an error when you try to save an empty list (block/item/potion/enchant blacklist).
