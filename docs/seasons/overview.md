### Unique Mechanics
Almost every season has its own *twist*, which affects the gameplay in some way:

::: details Third Life
No special unique mechanics.
:::

::: details Last Life
Every player will be randomly assigned between 2 and 6 lives.<br>
The Boogeyman curse - a randomly selected player must kill .
:::

::: details Double Life
Players are split into pairs that share a health bar - if one dies, the other dies as well.
:::

::: details Limited Life
Lives are measured in time, everyone has 24 hours to live.<br>
Killing players gains you time, while dying loses time faster.<br>
Limited life also re-introduces The Boogeyman.
:::

::: details Secret Life
You have 30 hearts, but they cannot regenerate by any means.<br>
Every player is given a secret task at the start of the session.<br>
If they fail, they are punished. If they succeed, they are rewarded.
:::

::: details Wild Life
Every session has its own twist, a Wildcard, which affects the gameplay in a certain way.
:::

::: details Nice Life
Nice Life is still in progress. Things may change.<br>
Once the clock strikes midnight, it stops moving. Everyone must sleep to pass the night, and can answer a question from the Santa Bot to get rewards. 
:::

## April Fools Seasons

::: details Real Life
Same as Third Life, but is meant to be played with a VR headset.
:::

::: details Simple Life
