# Nice Life

Nice Life is still in progress. Things may change.

## Overview

Nice Life is the eighth season of the Life Series.


Once the clock strikes midnight, it stops moving.

Everyone must sleep to pass the night, and can answer a question from the Santa Bot to get rewards.

Those that answer the question correctly are allowed to vote for players to be on the Nice or Naughty list.


It constantly snows in Nice Life in all biomes, and snow layers accumulate infinitely.

## Naughty List

Players on the naughty list have a purple name. They can be removed from the list by either dying, or by surviving until the next night (or session end).

They will glow periodically and lose the protection of a green or yellow name.

Anyone can hunt down people on the naughty list.

Purple names can still **defend** themselves

## Nice List

Players on the nice list have a pink name. 

At sunset, players on the nice list will vote to give a non-pink name a life.

The majority of the pinks must vote for the same player for the life to be given.

Pink names are not allowed to be targeted by any other players, including reds.

## Lives
All players are given 3 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
:::

Green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
