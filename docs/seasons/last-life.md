# Last Life

## Overview

Last Life is the second season of the Life Series.

All players are given a random amount from 2 to 6 lives at the beginning of the first session, so Good Luck!

At the start of each session, some players will become the [Boogeyman](/features/boogeyman), and will have to kill other players to get cured.

Players can use the `/lives` command to check their current number of lives.

Players can use the `/givelife <player>` command to give one of their lives to another player.

Enchanting tables are [blacklisted](/features/blacklists) in this season - there is only one table pre-placed in the world.

## Rules
All players are randomly given between 2 and 6 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Dark Green = 4+ lives
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
:::

Dark green, green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile (= you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone), and you must cut all ties with other players and alliances.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
