# Double Life

## Overview

Double Life is the third season of the Life Series.

The main (and only) twist of this season are the Soulmates.

Enchanting tables are [blacklisted](/features/blacklists) in this season - there is only one table pre-placed in the world.

## Soulmates
At the beginning of the first session, you will randomly be assigned another player on the server - your soulmate.

You and your soulmate share a health bar, so if they take damage, you take damage. And vice versa. Same goes for healing.

You will have the same soulmate for the entire duration of the series, and you cannot change your soulmate.

:::info
If you have absorption hearts, and you take damage, the damage will first go into them, and only if it damages your actual hearts will your soulmate get damaged as well. If you have absorbtion hearts and your soulmate takes damage, you will take actual damage from your real hearts.

If you have a Totem and you die, both you and your soulmate survive. If you have a totem and your soulmate dies, you will both die and your totem will not pop.

## Lives
All players are given 3 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)

Green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

:::info Initiate Combat
