# Simple Life

## Overview

Simple Life is the second **april fools** season of the Life Series.

Simple Life is played on a superflat world, where custom Wandering Traders spawn that sell resources for dirt.

## Lives
All players are given 3 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
  :::

Green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
