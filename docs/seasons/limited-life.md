# Limited Life

## Overview

Limited Life is the fourth season of the Life Series.

At the start of each session, one player will become the [Boogeyman](/features/boogeyman), and will have to kill other players to get cured.

The main twist of Limited Life is that the lives system is replaced with a time-based system.

## The Boogeyman
In Limited Life, the [Boogeyman](/features/boogeyman) rules are slightly modified compared to other seasons:
- There is only one Boogeyman per session.
- Once there are no more Green and Yellow players, Red players can also become the boogeyman, and they get cured by killing other Reds.

## Time

In Limited Life, instead of lives, players have time.

All players are given 24 hours at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Time Colors
- Green = 16+ hours
- Yellow = 8+ hours
- Red = < 8 hours (hostile)
  :::

You lose time as time passes (duh xD)

If you die, you lose 1 hour.

If you kill a person, you gain 30 minutes.

If you kill a person as the Boogeyman the time rewards / punishments for killing / dying will be doubled.

Dark green and green players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you are Yellow, you can *initiate combat* on Dark Green players.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
