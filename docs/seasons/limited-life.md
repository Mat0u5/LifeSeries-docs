# Limited Life

## Overview

Limited Life is the fourth season of the Life Series.

At the start of each session, one player will become the [Boogeyman](/features/boogeyman), and will have to kill other players to get cured.

The main twist of Limited Life is that the lives system is replaced with a time-based system.

## Time

In Limited Life, instead of lives, players have time.

All players are given 24 hours at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Time Colors
- Green = 16+ hours
- Yellow = 8+ hours
- Red = < 8 hours (hostile)
  :::

You lose time as time passes (duh xD)

If you die, you lose 1 hour.

If you kill a person, you gain 30 minutes.

If you kill a person as the Boogeyman the time rewards / punishments for killing / dying will be doubled.

Green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red or the Boogeyman that initiated combat against you.

In Limited Life, Yellow players are allowed to *initiate combat* on **Green Players**. Let the chaos ensue!

Once you become a Red, you become hostile (= you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone), and you must cut all ties with other players and alliances.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
