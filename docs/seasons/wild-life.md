# Wild Life

## Overview

Wild Life is the sixth season of the Life Series.

The main twist of Wild Life is the addition of Wildcards.

## Wildcards
Every session, a random Wildcard is selected (or an admin can manually select one if they don't want it to be random).

A Wildcard essentially adds a unique twist to each session. Some Wildcards can be helpful, some can be deadly - each session is unique.

## Lives
All players are given 6 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Dark Green = 4+ lives
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
:::

Dark green and green players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you are Yellow, you can *initiate combat* on Dark Green players.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

Killing a Dark Green player will gain you a life.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
