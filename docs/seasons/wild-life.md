# Wild Life

## Overview

Wild Life is the sixth season of the Life Series.

The main twist of Wild Life is the addition of Wildcards.

## Wildcards
Every session, a random Wildcard is selected (or an admin can manually select one if they don't want it to be random).

A Wildcard essentially adds a unique twist to each session. Some Wildcards can be helpful, some can be deadly - each session is unique.

There are a total of 8 different Wildcards:
:::info Size Shifting Wildcard
Sneaking makes you shrink, while jumping makes you grow larger.
:::
:::info Hunger Wildcard
All items are edible, and they give a random amount of hunger points and saturation.<br>
Eating anything can also give you a random potion effect.<br>
One the same item will always have the same effect as the first time you eat it, until food gets randomized throughout the session.<br>
Hunger depletes a lot faster.
:::
:::info Snails Wildcard
Every player has an immortal snail coming after them.<br>
The snail moves slowly, but if it ever touches you, you die instantly.
:::
:::info Time Dilation Wildcard
Time slows down to a halt at the start of the session, gets faster and faster as time goes on.
:::
:::info Trivia Wildcard
Trivia bots, custom entities that give you a trivia question, spawn for players.<br>
Answering the question correctly gives you a reward, answering incorrectly gives you a punishment.
:::
:::info Mob Swap Wildcard
Mobs are periodically swapped with other random mobs throughout the session.
:::
:::info Superpowers Wildcard
Every player is given a random superpower at the start of the session.
:::
:::info Callback Wildcard
Throughout the session, random other Wildcards get activated and deactivated.
:::

## Lives
All players are given 6 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Dark Green = 4+ lives
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
:::

Dark green and green players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you are Yellow, you can *initiate combat* on Dark Green players.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

Killing a Dark Green player will gain you a life.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
