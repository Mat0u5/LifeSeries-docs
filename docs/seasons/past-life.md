# Past Life

## Overview

Past Life is the seventh season of the Life Series.

At the start of the session, an admin will be able to choose between playing with the [Secret Society](/features/secret-society) enabled, or with the [Boogeyman](/features/boogeyman) enabled.

## Version Changing
The main twist of Past Life is that every session is played on a different version of Minecraft. That, obviously, cannot be done with this one mod, as it's only compatible with 1.21+.

I've made a separate project on Modrinth which has **only** the Past Life mod for each of the versions used in the original series.

The separate Past Life mod can be found [here on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/past-life)

::: warning
Keep in mind that the setup is quite difficult for the earliest mc versions.

Make sure you read the instructions on the Modrinth page for the Past Life mod.
:::

Past Life is still fully playable with this mod, it just won't have the different versions aspect.

## Lives
All players are given 6 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Dark Green = 4+ lives
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives
- Red = 1 life (hostile)
  :::

Dark green, green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.

:::info Initiate Combat
Initiate Combat = causing any unlawful act, such as: attacking, griefing, stealing, trapping,...<br>
Combat stops once both parties flee or once a peace agreement is reached.
