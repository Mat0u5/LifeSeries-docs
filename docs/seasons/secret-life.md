# Secret Life

## Overview

Secret Life is the fifth season of the Life Series.


In Secret Life, players are given secret tasks to complete during each session. Completing these tasks rewards you with hearts, while failing can punish you.

In Secret Life, players start with 30 hearts (which is also the maximum amount of hearts), and they do not regenerate health by traditional means. The only way to regain hearts is by completing tasks and by being gifted a heart.

Once per session, each player can freely gift one heart to another player, with no cost to your own hearts using the `/gift <player>` command.


## Tasks

Every session, players will be given a task to do. Players have time until the end of the session to complete their tasks, or else they automatically fail.

Completing tasks gives you hearts (or items, if you are at the max of 30 hearts) as rewards.

Failing a task can either do nothing or it can punish you by taking away your hearts, depending on the type of the task.

The way to submit/ re-roll / fail your task is by going to the Secret Keeper, a special location on the map with three buttons, one for succeeding a task, one for re-rolling it, and one for failing a task.
<br><br>
Easy Tasks - Default task for non-red players. If you succeed, you gain 10 hearts. If you fail, you get nothing. Easy tasks can be re-rolled for a Hard task.

Hard Tasks - If you succeed, you gain 20 hearts. If you fail, you lose 10 hearts. Cannot be re-rolled.

Red Tasks - Given to red players, these tasks involve hurting or killing other players. If you complete this task, you gain 5 hearts. If you fail, you lose 2.5 hearts. Once you complete / fail a Red task, you will be given a new one - so Red players always have a task to do. If a Red player kills another player, they are automatically awarded +10 hearts, and these, similarly to gifted hearts, can bypass the 30 max heart limit.

## Lives
All players are given 3 lives at the beginning of the first session.

:::info Life Colors
- Green = 3 lives
- Yellow = 2 lives

Green and Yellow players are not allowed to *initiate combat*, unless in self defence from a Red that *initiated combat* against you.

Once you become a Red, you become hostile = you can freely *initiate combat* on anyone.
