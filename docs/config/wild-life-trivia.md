## Configuring Trivia Rewards

Trivia Rewards are stored as a minecraft loot table, and can be customized in the config file:
- `config/lifeseries/wildlife/trivia_reward_loottable_<version>.json`

`<version>` is the major minecraft version you are using, for example `1.21.9`.

:::tip
I recommend using a loot table editor, such as the [Misode Loot Table Generator](https://misode.github.io/loot-table), to modify the loot table.
